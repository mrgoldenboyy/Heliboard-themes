# HeliBoard Terminal Themes

I got tired of my keyboard feeling like a third-party intruder every time I pulled up a terminal on my phone. These themes were built to bridge that gap.

By pulling the exact hex values from **Termux** `color.properties` files, I’ve made these keyboards feel like a native part of the UI. They don't just "match"—they belong.

## ⚡ The Lineup

I’ve started with the essentials. If you use these color schemes in your IDE or terminal, your keyboard will now disappear into the background:

* **Gruvbox:** That classic, warm retro-groove. Easy on the eyes for long sessions.
* **TokyoNight Dark:** Deep blues and crisp neons. Perfect for late-night builds.
* **Rose Pine:** Ethereal, low-contrast, and surprisingly clean on a mobile screen.
* **Dracula:** The gold standard for high-contrast dark mode.

## 🛠️ Design Philosophy

These aren't just "copy-pasted" colors. I took the raw palette from Termux and made manual adjustments to:

1. **Key Contrast:** Tweaked the background-to-text ratio so you aren't squinting.
2. **Toolbar Icons:** Adjusted the icons so they pop against the terminal colors without being a distraction.
3. **Visual Weight:** Balanced the color application so the keyboard feels like it has the same "weight" as your terminal window.

## 🚀 How to use them

1. Grab the `.json` theme files from the folder above.
2. In **HeliBoard Settings**, go to **Appearance > Colors** > **Load** > **Load file**.
3. Match it with your Termux theme and enjoy the seamless look.
